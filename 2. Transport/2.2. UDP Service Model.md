# UPD Service Model

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is used by applications that does not need the guaranteed reliable delivery of TCP. The application may implement their own delivery strategy, or just simply has no need for reliability.

Three properties of UDP:
* connectionless datagram service:
  * no connection established
  * packets may show up in any order
* self-contained datagrams
* unreliable delivery
  * no acknowledge
  * no mechanism to detect missing or mis-sequenced datagram
  * no flow control
