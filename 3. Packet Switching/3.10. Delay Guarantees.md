# Delay Guarantees

How to control the delay of packets?

What has been known:
* The rate at which a queue is served (WFQ)
* The size of each queue

We need to make sure the no packet will be drop before making a guarantee on the packet delay. It needs some control on the arrival rate so that the queue does not overflow.

It uses a tech called **sigma-rho-constraint**. It is a constraint that the arrival rate does not overflow the queue and the packet delay is smaller than a fix number.

If flows are leaky-bucket constraint, and routers use WFQ, then end-to-end delay
guarantees are possible.

Leaky-bucket constraint implements the sigma-rho-constraint. A leaky bucket has a fixed size (like buffer size) and a fixed rate to fill with tokens. When a packet is in a queue, it is only sent if there is enough token in the bucket.

In summary:
* If we know the size of a queue and the rate at which it is served, then we can bound the delay through it.
* We can pick the size of the queue, and WFQ lets use pick at which it is served.
* Therefore we just need a way to prevent packets being dropped along the way. For this, we use a leaky bucket regulator.
* Therefore we can bound the end to end delay.
