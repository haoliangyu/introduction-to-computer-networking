# Sliding Window

The problem of stop-and-wait strategy is inefficiency. It must use a round-trip to confirm a data delivery and that limits the delivery rate.

Sliding window is a generalization of sliding window. Instead of sending one packet at a time, it sends and acks multiple packets at a time, so call a window. It can keep the pipe full.

The sender maintains three variables:
* send window size (SWS)
* last acknowledge received (LAR)
* last segment sent (LSS)

The receiver maintains three variables:
* receive window size (RWS)
* last acceptable segment (LAS)
* last segment received (LSR)
