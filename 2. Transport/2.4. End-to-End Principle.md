# End-to-End Principle

Why do the network do more like:
* compress/reformat data
* caching data
* send requests to a faster server
* more

It turns out that the network can do much more, but it does not, because of the end-to-end principle. The problem is that it relies on the application at both ends to correctly implement the same feature. It says, in a routing path, it requires all hops to implement the additional feature correctly, so that the data can transfer without corruption.

End-to-end check is still required to validate file.

A stronger version of the principle is to tell not to implement any feature in the middle, but at the fringes. Let say one add a new feature in the link layer to help improve reliability and the network layer relies on it. So because of this reliability, the link layer will become more difficult to change and update. This is for the long-term maintainability, but for the short-term and optimization need, this rule is not often followed. So as the network performance becomes better and better, the network itself becomes harder and harder to change.
