# Rate Guarantees

FIFO is a free for all as it accepts all input sources. The source with higher rate is more likely to be the output.

The maximum message delay is equal to the size of the queue divided to the output rate.

## Strict Priorities

To apply priority in a FIFO queue, we can simply use multiple FIFO queues, each of which receives packets of a priority, and combine them as a structure.

The low priority queues are only dispatched if the high priority queues are empty. It ensures the high priority queues are always being processed. It is useful when the high priority traffic is limited.

A variation of this is based on weighted Priorities. So the output rate of each queue is decided by the queue weight.

But as it handles at packet level, it is affected by the actual packet length and long packet may take more resource than expected, therefore disrespect the weight.

Weighted Fair Queueing, WFQ, is a tech that let us give each flow a guaranteed service rate, by scheduling them in order of their bit-by-bit finishing times.
