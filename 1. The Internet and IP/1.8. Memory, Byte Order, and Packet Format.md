# Memory, Byte Order, and Packet Format

## Byte Order

Given a number is larger than 2 bytes

1024 = 0x400

At **little endian**, least significant byte is at lowest address. It makes most sense from an addressing/computational standpoint.

At **big endian**, most significant byte is at lowest address. It makes most sense to a human reader.

## Packet Format

Since different system may use different endianness, it is important to figure out the format of the byte in the packet.

Internet Protocol uses big endianness. One has to convert network byte order values to the host order.
