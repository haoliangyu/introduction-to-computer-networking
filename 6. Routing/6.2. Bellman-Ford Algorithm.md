# Bellman-Ford Algorithm

an example of distance vector algorithm

find minimal spanning tree among routers to a specific destination

assume each router knows its cost of link to its neighborhoods

router maintains the value cost to the destination

the algorithm iteratively finds the shortest path from the given destination to each node of the graph

it is guaranteed to converge after running count == longest hop path in the network

(see the slides for more details of how the algorithm runs)
