# Packet Switching

## Circuit Switching

**Circuit Switching** is a predecessor of **Packet Switching** and is widely used in the telephone system.

Two telephones are connected with a dedicated wire for these two phones, therefore a circuit. Circuit switching is the automation to create these circuits.

A circuit is not shared by anyone else and has a limited capacity, for only voice data. A fiber can has a limited number of circuits.

Problems:
* Inefficiency. The computer communications tend to be very bursty..
* Diverse Rates. The computer communications may have a very rate
* State Management. Circuit switches maintain per-communication state, which must be managed.

## Packet Switching

A packet can be sent at anywhere and anytime. It does not need a pre-built dedicated connection.

Packet switches have buffers, which hold packets:
* when two or more packets arrive at the same time
* during period of congestion

Packet switching properties:
* packets are routed individually, by looking up address in router's local state
* all packets share the full capacity of a link
* the routers maintain no per-communication state
