# The Principle of Packet Switching

**Packet** is a self-contained unit of data that carries information necessary for it to reach its destination.

**Packet Switching** is a way to break the data into discrete and self-contained packets that a network can deliver. It independently pick each arriving packet's outgoing link. If the link is free, send it. Else hold the packet for later.

Two consequences:
* simple packet forwarding
* efficient sharing of links

A **flow** is a sequence of datagrams belonging to the same end-to-end communication, like a TCP connection. There is no per-flow state in packet switching. Therefore, managing packets is simple

Data traffic is bursty:
* Packet switching allows flows to use all available link capacity. It sends as fast as possible.
* Packet switching allows flows to share link capacity because no per-flow state exists.

This is called **Statistical Multiplexing**.
