# Basic Approaches

## Network-based Congestion Control

In network-based congestion control, a router should signal upstream routers about the congestion situation, so that upstream routers can adjust flow rate accordingly.

For example, a few bits can be used in the packet ack signal to indicate the congestion situation. As the ack packet travels through the network, it gives the congestion information to each router.

But this requires the network (any device) to support the way of congestion control.

## End-host based Congestion Control

In this way, only the end-host is responsible for congestion control.

For example, the source host can observe dropped (timeout) packets as a signal of possible congestion. If the timeout rate increases, it can decrease the output rate.

It is the way used by TCP:
* reacts to events observable at the end host
* exploits TCP's sliding window used for flow control
* Tries to figure out how many packets it can safely have outstanding in the network at a time

TCP varies the number of outstanding packets in the network by varying the window size:

window size = min(advertised window (from receiver), congestion window)

The congestion window is decided with a method called AIMD, or Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease:

* If packet received OK: W = W + 1 / W
* If packet received not OK: W = W / 2
