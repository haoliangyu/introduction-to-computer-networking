# Packet Switching (A)

## Ethernet Switch

1. Examine the header of each arriving frame
2. If the Ethernet DA is in the forwarding table, forward the frame to the correct port(s).
3. If the Ethernet DA is not in the table, broadcast the frame to ALL port.
4. Entries in the table are learned by examining the Ethernet SA of arriving packets.

The forwarding table stores exact addresses.

It looks for exact match in the forwarding table and send to an exact port.

## Internet Router

1. If the Ethernet DA of the arriving frame belongs to the router, accept the frame. Else drop it.
2. Examine the IP version and length of the datagram.
3. Decrement the TTL, update the IP header checksum
4. Check to see if TTL == 0
5. If the IP DA is in the forwarding table, forward to the correct engress prot for the next hop
6. Find the Ethernet DA for the next hop Router
7. Create a new Ethernet frame and send it

The forwarding table stores addres mask.

It uses longest prefix match, not the exact match. Tree tries structure may be used here.

## Generic Lookup

A generic lookup table combines two so that in a table it can match the mask or the exact address.

## Summary

Packet switches perform two basic operations:
* lookup addresses in a forwarding table
* switching to the correct engress port
