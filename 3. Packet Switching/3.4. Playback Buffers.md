# Playback Buffers

A playback buffer is a buffer that receives packets ahead of time, before the packet is viewed by the use, so that the variation of network delay can be absorbed. It is generally used by video websites, like YouTube.

In a playback buffer, there is a playback point. Only after reaching that point, the client starts to read the buffer in a normal and constant rate, in order to avoid the variance from the Internet delay. With the buffer, packets may arrive in the buffer with a variant rate but then are read with a fixed rate later.
