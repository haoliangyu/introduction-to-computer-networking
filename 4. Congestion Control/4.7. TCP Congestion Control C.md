# TCP Congestion Control C

## Fast Retransmission

Don't wait for a timeout to retransmit a missing segment if you receive a triple duplicate acknowledgement.

## Fast Recovery

Halve the congestion window (instead of setting it to 1) on triple duplicate acknowledgement.

While in fast recovery state, inflate the congestion window as acknowledgement arrives, to keep data flowing.
