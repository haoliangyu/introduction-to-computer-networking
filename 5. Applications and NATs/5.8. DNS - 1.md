# DNS

Three basic part of an url:
* application protocol and port
* host
* file

Originally, there was `HOSTS.txt` that maps IP addresses -> human readable address, but it did not scale well.

## Domain Name System

Two properties that make DNS possible:
* read-only database, that is optimized for read
* loose consistency, so changes can be propagated slower

These two allow good caching capability

## DNS Architecture

DNS servers have a tree-like architecture, like roo server -> top level domain (TLD) server, like `com` => domain server, `google` -> `www`

Each node may have a number of servers that could balance the traffic.

## DNS Query

* recursive: query that includes many sub-questions

for examole, asking `www.google.com` includes the question for `com`, `google`, and `www`.

* non-recursive: query that only includes one question

like the one asking about the IP address of `google` from one server
