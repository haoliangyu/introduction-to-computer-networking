# Address Resolution Protocol

**Address Resolution Protocol** (ARP) is a mechanism by which the network layer can discover the link address (at the link layer) associated with a network address it is directly connected to.

It is needed because each protocol layer has it own names and addresses. A link address is a unique address to a network card, a device to send and receive data at the link layer.

The network address and link address are usually coupled in practice (though not in theory) and ARP is to provide the mapping between them. It broadcasts a network address inquiry to the network and nodes can reply if it has a match. Other nodes can insert or refresh their internal mapping based on that broadcast, but not response.
