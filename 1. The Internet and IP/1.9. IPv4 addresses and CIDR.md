# IPv4 addresses and CIDR

The original goal of the Internet Protocol Addresses is to stitch many different networks together. Therefore it needs network-independent, unique address.

An IPv4 is an address to identify a device on the Internet and it is 32 bits long (a.b.c.d).

Netmask like `255.255.255.0` is to help identify whether two addresses are in the same network. It is used to perform bit-and operation with addresses and compare the result. If they are the same, two addresses are in the same network.

Today the IPv4 address uses **Classless Inter-Domain Routing** (CIDR) for its structure. An address block is a pair: address/count. For example, 171.64.0.0/16 means any address in the range 171.64.0.0 to 171.64.255.255. The count specifies the netmask length.
