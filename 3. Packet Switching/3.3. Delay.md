# Terminology

## Propagation Delay

The time it takes for a single bit to travel over a link at a given propagation speed. The propagation speed is usually very close to the light speed and the travel distance is the geographic distance.

## Packetization Delay

The time from when the first to the last bit of a packet is transmitted.

## End-to-End Delay

This is the time for a packet to travel from the source to the destination. It is the sum of, the propagation delay, the packetization delay, and the delay of packets in the switch queue at every link.
