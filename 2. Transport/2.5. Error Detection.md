# Error Detection

Network today mainly uses three different ways to detect errors:
* Checksum
* Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC)
* Message Authentication Code (MAC)

Checksum is fast and cheap to compute but only provides weak guarantee. It can only detect single bit erros.

CRC is more expensive than the checksum, but has stronger error detection capability.

MAC is the cryptographic information of the data.
