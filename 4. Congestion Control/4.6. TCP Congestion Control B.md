RTT estimation, self-clocking: when to send data retransmission

## RTT estimation

Round trip time estimation is critical for timeout:
* too short: waste capacity with retransmission, trigger slow start
* too longer: waste capacity with idle time

Challenge:
* RTT is highly dynamic
* RTT is specific to load

RTT is estimated using the last RTT adding an adjustment factor, which is decided by the measure error. Timeout is calculated from the RTT.

Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) 

## Self-Clocking

The sender receives the acks with a speed decided by the bottleneck link in the network. Thus, the sender can adjust its rate with the ack.

Principles:
* Only put data in when data has left, in order to prevent data congestion
* Send new data in response to the acknowledgement
* Send acknowledgement aggressively
