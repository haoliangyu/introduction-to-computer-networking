# TCP Service Model

TCP provides a reliable, end-to-end, bi-directional byte-stream service.

When two applications use TCP, they establish the TCP communication channel from A to B. Then another TCP channel is established from B to A. This is called the two-way connection and at each end of the connection a state machine is used to keep track of the status.

The channel establishment uses three-way handshakes: SYN, ACK > SYNC, ACK.

Stream of bytes is delivered with TCP segments.

The channel teardown also uses three-way handshakes: FIN, ACK > DATA > FIN, ACK. First FIN + ACK closes the connection from A to B as it is A to file the FIN request. Then B can ack back to close the A -> B connection but may keep sending its data to A till end. Finally, B will send A FIN message to A. The connection now is fully closed and the state can be removed.

Four properties of TCP service model:
* Stream of bytes
* Reliable delivery
  * Acknowledgements indicate correct delivery
  * Checksums detect corrupted data
  * Sequence numbers detect missing data
  * Flow-control prevents overrunning receiver
* In-sequence
* Congestion control

Any Internet connection is uniquely identified with the following five things:
* Protocol ID (IP)
* IP destination address (IP)
* IP source address (IP)
* Source port (TCP)
* Destination port (TCP)


TCP connections initialize with a **random** initial sequence number to refer to bytes in the byte stream.
