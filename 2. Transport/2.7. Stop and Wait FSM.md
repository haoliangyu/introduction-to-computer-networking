# Stop and Wait FSM

A classic problem of flow control is a sender can send messages faster than the receiver can receive. There are two basic solutions: stop-and-wait and sliding window.

Stop and wait algorithm steps:
* at most one packet in flight at any time
* sender sends one packet
* receiver sends acknowledgement packet when it receives data
* on receiving acknowledgement, sender sends new data
* on timeout, sender resends current data

In some cases, packet duplicates happen and one can:
* use 1 big counter in data and acknowledgement
  * receiver can tell if new data or duplicate
  * simplified assumptions: no duplicate packets or no delayed multiple timeouts
