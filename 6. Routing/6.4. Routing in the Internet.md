# Routing in the Internet

## Autonomous Systems

The Internet is a collection of connected Autonomous Systems (AS), which is a group of connected routers.

* within an AS, the owner decides how routing is done
* between ASs, must use BGP-4 (Border Gateway Protocol, v4) as communication protocol

## Interior Routing Protocls

### RIP

Uses distance vector (distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm)

Updates sent every 30s

### OSPF

Link-state updates sent (using flooding) as and when required

Every router runs Dijstra

Authenticated Updates

Autonomous system may be partitioned into many areas

## Interior Routing

### AS with one exit point

All routers forward external packets to the default router,  which is the border gateway to the next AS.

### AS with multiple exit pointss

Approaches:
* Hot-potato routing: send packages to the closest exit
* Pick exit closest to the destination (lowest cost routing)

## Exterior Routing Protocol

Every AS must use BGP-4.

Problems to solve:
* Topology: Internet is complex mesh of different AS's with very little structure
* Autonomy of AS's: Each AS defines link costs in differnet ways, so not possible to find lowest cost paths
* Trust: Some AS's can't trust others to advertise good routes, or to protect privacy of traffic
* Policies: AS's may have different objectives for routing

## Internet Structure

Tier 1 ISP -> Regional ISP -> Access ISP -> Customer
