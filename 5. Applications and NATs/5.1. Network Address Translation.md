# Network Address Translation

## Strong End-to-End

This is the concept that the network's job is to transmit datagram between two edges as fast as possible and as flexible as possible. Everything else should be done at two edges (applications) of the network.

## Network Address Translation

The device `NAT` serves as a gateway between the internal network (for example, your home network) and the external network (like Internet). It has its own IP address and makes any traffic from the internal network look like from that IP.

For outbound traffic, the NAT updates the datagram to change the internal private IP addresses with its own IP address.

For inboud traffic, the NAT updates the datagram to change the destination address to the private address.

It is a way to let many nodes to share one IP address.

## How does a NAT work?

Basically, when the NAT receives a package from the internal private address, it creates a mapping between the private address:port and the NAT's address:port. This will help the response package being routed to the correct private address and port.

Note that the mapping is created only for the outbound traffic.
