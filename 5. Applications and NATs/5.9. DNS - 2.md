# DNS

## Resource Record

All DNS information can be represented in Resource Records (RRs):

```
name [TTL] [class] type rdata
```

* name: domain name
* TTL: time to live (in seconds)
* class: class of network (usually, 1 for Internet)
* type: type of the record
* rdata: resource data depend on type

Two typical RR types: A (IPv4 address) and NS (name server)

The domain name can appear at the resource record multiple times. To reduce the size of the record, the domain name can be compressed.
