# Concepts

## Observations
* Congestion is inevitable and desirable (because it means the network is fully used)
* Congestion happens at different time scales
* If packets are dropped, then retransmission can make the congestion worse.
* If packets are dropped, it wastes resources at upstream for sending them.
* A definition of "fairness" is needed to decide how flows can shared a bottleneck link.

## Max-min fairness

You cannot increase the rate of one flow without decreasing the rate of another flow with a lower rate.

### Allocation

For multiple flows, the flows with a rate smaller than the fair share will be allocated first and then other links will get equal shares of the rest of the link.

## Goals

* High throughput: keep links busy and flows fast
* Max-min fairness
* Respond quickly to changing network conditions
* Distributed control
