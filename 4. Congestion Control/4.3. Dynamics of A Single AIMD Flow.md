# Dynamics of A Single AIMD Flow

In an AIMD flow, the outgoing rate is constant because the window size (W) and round-trip time (RTT) are adjusted at the same direction. Note that `rate = W / RTT`.

As the window size increases, more bytes are sent into the router buffer and the delay time for each byte increases as well.

## Observations

* Window expands/contracts according to AIMD.
* It is by probing how many bytes the pipe can hold.
* The sending rate is constant if there is sufficient buffers (should be equal to the link rate times round trip time).
