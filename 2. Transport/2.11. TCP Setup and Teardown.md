# TCP Setup and Teardown

Reliable communication typically benefits from having some states on each end of a connection.

TCP connection setup usually uses a three-way handshake, but simultaneous connection is also possible.

TCP connection teardown steps:
* A -> B: FIN, seq Sa, ACK Sb
* B -> A: ACK Sa+1
* B -> A: FIN, seq Sb, ACK Sa+
* A -> B: ACK Sb+1

S stands for the stream sequence number at A/B. It would not teardown completely until both sides have no data to send. Simultaneous close is possible.

To clean up safely, like in case the final FIN signal is lost, the A server may have a timeout setting. Once it reaches the timeout time, A server can teardown the connection by itself.
