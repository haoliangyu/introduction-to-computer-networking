# Types of NATs

## NAT Internal Mapping

The NAT maintains an internal mapping:

internal IP + port <-> external interface IP + port at NAT

Two questions:
* What packets do a NAT allow to traverse mappings?
* How and when does a NAT assign mappings?

## Full Cone NAT

least restricted NAT, any packets can pass through the NAT, regardless of the source IP and port.

## Restricted Cone NAT

Filter based on the source IP address (but not the port), as it is on the mappings

## Port Restricted NAT

Like restricted cone NAT, but also filter by the source port

## Symmetric NAT

port restricted

If there are packets sent to different destination addresses and ports, the NAT sets up different mappings for the same internal IP and port.
