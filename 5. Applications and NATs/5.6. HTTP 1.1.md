# HTTP 1.1

In HTTP/1.0, a connection is built for each request and it would take a large amount of time if many connections are to setup.

The main advance of HTTP/1.1 is to have a header to tell the server not to close the connection after response. So that the next request/response could use the same connection and cut down the connection setup time.
