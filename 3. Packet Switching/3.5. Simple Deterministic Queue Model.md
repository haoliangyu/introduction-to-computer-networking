# Simple Deterministic Queue Model

Given:
* **At** is the cumulative number of bytes arrived up until time t.
* **Qt** is the number of bytes in the queue.
* **Dt** is the cumulative number of bytes departed up until time t.
* **R** is the link rate.

There are
* Qt = At - Dt

## Why break a packet into smaller ones?

Because it can parallel transmissing packets across all links, reducing end-to-end latency.

Statistical multiplexing lets us carry many flows efficiently on a single link.
