# AIMD with Multiple Flows

When there are multiple flows, the router buffer is likely to stay full almost all the time. It is because while one flow halves its window size to reduce network work load, the other flows are still increasing its window size.

So it is reasonable to consider the round trip travel time as a constant.

## Summary

* Throughput of an AIMD flow is sensitive to the drop probability and is very sensitive to the RTT
* With many flows, each flow follows its own AIMD rule
* If the bottleneck contains packets from many flows, the buffer is going to remain highly occupied all the time
* Above implies that RTT seen by the packets is constant
