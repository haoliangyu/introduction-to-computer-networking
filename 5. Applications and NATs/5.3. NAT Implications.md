# NAT Implications

If a server is behind a NAT, an external server is unable to build connection with that server, because of no mappings.

## Connection Reversal

An external reversal server is up to build the connection for both sides. The private server first sends a request to the reversal server and creates a mapping at the NAT. Then the other server can use that mapping for direct connection.

# Relays

If two servers are both behind NAT, they need a relay server for communication.

## NAT Debat

* very useful: reuse IP address, security
* very painful: application development is hard before standarization
* stroke Internet: new protocol needs NAT's support for popularity but NAT developer does not want to support new protocol until it is popular.
